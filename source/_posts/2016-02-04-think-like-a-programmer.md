Dictionary.com definined programming as “a plan of action to accomplish a specified end” (Dictionary.com). Programming is more than just plugging code into a computer, it’s creating a plan to solve a problem. Solving a problem is naturally difficult, so to become a good programmer, you need to have the mindset of a problem solver. 
A study done at Stanford University by Carol Dweck illustrated that there are two types of mindsets, a “growth mindset” and a “fixed mindset” (Popova). The main difference is that a growth mindset views challenges as hurdles ment for them to jump over and a fixed mindset views challenges as a dead end filled with failure. A growth mindset has “a hunger for learning” (Popova). In programming, one will often write 30 lines of code, just to run it and find that it is filled with errors. If that programmer has a growth mindset, they will look at this as an opportunity to increase their programming skill. Someone with a fixed mindset might give up right away. Looking further at this same study, those with a growth mindset responded much better to confusion than those with a fixed mindset. In fact, only 30% of those with a fixed mindset correctly completed the task assigned to them while 70% of those with a growth mindset correctly completed the task (Kaptur). Confusion is a common feeling when error messages popped up, because everyone programming always thinks their code is great (at least I do). Therefore, I completely agree that a growth mindset is the best way to think like a successful programmer and overcome the many obstacles one might face. 
To further back up the importance of looking at problems with a growth mindset, Forbes published an article about how successful leaders solve problems. Successful problem-solvers “see around, beneath, and beyond the problem itself. They see well beyond the obvious. The most effective leaders approach problems through a lens of opportunity” (Llopis). I’m sure that the “lens of opportunity” sounds very similar to the traits of a growth mindset. That’s because successful leaders look at problems almost as a strength competition between them and the problem. I’m guessing the successful leaders usually win.
In the end, if one wants to think like a successful programmer, they have to view the problem as their rival challenging them to a race. They need to look at the problem, error, or source of confusion as an opportunity for them to enhance their skills.
